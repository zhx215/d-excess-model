# d-excess-model
The code for isotope-enabled vapor transport model with raindrop re-evaporation, which reproduces the Figure 5a. Any formal use of the model should accompany the citation of the original publication if necessary (Xia and Winnick, 2021, EPSL). If you use these codes intensively for a project, I will be happy to be involved.
